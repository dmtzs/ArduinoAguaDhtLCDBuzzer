# ArduinoAguaDhtLCDBuzzer
 Arduino project in which a dht22 sensor is integrated for temperature and humidity detection, a water sensor along with a buzzer to monitor the terrarium of my pet, a snake
 
 You need to download the dht.h libary from adafruit but that is the only library that you need to download previously other libraries are already integrated in arduinoÂ´s IDE
 We will keep improving more the code in order to do more friendly the functionality

## Libraries
* Download and include dht.h library from adafruit

## Materials list
* 16x2 LCD
* dht22 sensor
